- **`/coins/{id}`** - Gets detailed information for specific coins
- **`/coins/{id}/market_chart`** - Retrieves historical price data for charts

#### Features Powered by CoinGecko:

- 📊 **Real-time Prices** - Live cryptocurrency prices with automatic updates
- 📈 **Market Statistics** - Market cap, trading volume, and price changes
- 🕒 **Historical Data** - 10-day price history for interactive charts
- 🌍 **Multi-Currency** - Support for USD, EUR, and INR pricing
- 🔍 **Comprehensive Data** - Market rank, supply data, and price statistics

#### API Configuration:

```javascript
// Example API call from CoinContext.jsx
const options = {
    method: "GET",
    headers: {
        accept: "application/json",
        "x-cg-demo-api-key": import.meta.env.VITE_COINGECKO_API_KEY,
    },
};

fetch(
    `https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/markets?vs_currency=${currency.name}`,
    options,
);
```

#### Proxy Setup:

The app uses Vite proxy configuration to handle API requests and avoid CORS issues:

```javascript
// vite.config.js
server: {
  proxy: {
    '/api': {
      target: 'https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3',
      changeOrigin: true,
      rewrite: (path) => path.replace(/^\/api/, '')
    }
  }
}
```
